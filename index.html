        Images are an important part of the web and included on almost every webpage. They can capture
        the users attention, instantly convey messages and how they are used can make or break a website.
        It is important to get them right. Which is why we decided to make our project about images.
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Img-Tag</h2>
        <p>The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag is a fundamental element used to embed images into a web page. This tag
            allows you to
            display visual content, such as photographs, illustrations, icons and more.
            <br><br>
            <code>&lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image"&gt;</code>
            <br><br>
            You can also use external links as the source for your images by specifying a URL in the <code>src</code>
            attribute:
            <br><br>
            <code>&lt;img src="https://example.com/image.jpg" alt="Description of the image"&gt;</code>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Image Position</h2>
        <p>
            The position attribute in CSS is a tool for controlling the layout of elements, especially images.
            Whether adjusting their position relative to the normal flow, placing them precisely within a container,
            or fixing them during scrolling, this attribute is an essential part in building a website.
        </p>
        <p><a href="./CodeExamples/ImagePosition/ImagePosition.html" class="nav-link">See examples about the position
                attribute.</a></p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Image Fit</h2>
        <p>
            Including images in a website often requires consideration of how they adapt to varying screen sizes
            and aspect ratios. <code>object-fit</code> provides a tool for controlling how an image (or any element)
            behaves
            within its container, particularly when dealing with dynamically sized elements.</p>
        <p><a href="./CodeExamples/ImageFit/ImageFit.html" class="nav-link">See examples about image fit.</a></p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Aspect Ratio</h2>
        <p>The <code>aspect ratio</code> attribute can be used to set a containers aspect ratio without specifying its
            height or width. With <code>aspect ratio: 1 / 1;</code> for example an image can be forced to 1:1 instead of
            its initial ratio. If either width or height is set, the other will be scaled accordingly.
            If both are - aspect ratio will be ignored.
            <code>aspect ratio: auto</code> Is the default option - the element behaving as it usually
            would. When providing both auto and a ratio (e.g. <code>aspect ratio: auto 2 / 1;</code>) the ratio is used
            for
            normal elements and auto is applied to <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Replaced_element">replaced elements</a>
            like <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>.

        <h2>Flexbox</h2>
        <p>
            Flexbox is a powerful layout model that simplifies the arrangement of images within a webpage.
            Flexbox allows for precise control over the alignment, distribution, and order of images, optimizing their
            presentation on different screen sizes.

                flexbox works.</a></p>

    <section>
        <h2>Background Images</h2>
        <p>
            Background images can be used to enhance the visual appeal of a webpage. They can be applied to the entire
            page or specific sections, providing a way to customize the aesthetic and
            create a more engaging user experience.

        <h2>Web Performance</h2>
        <p>
            Images take a long time to download (in comparison to the rest of the website).
            So it's important to think about what and how many images to use.<br>
            There are different kinds of images to choose from, these are the most common:<br>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>JPG</strong><br>
                Ideal for photographs and images with gradients.<br>
                Lossy compression, which may result in some loss of quality.<br>
                Moderate to small file size, depending on the compression level.
            </li>
            <li><strong>PNG</strong><br>
                For images with transparency or a need for high-quality graphics.<br>
                Lossless compression, maintains high quality.
                Generally larger file size than JPG.
            <li><strong>GIF</strong><br>
                Best for simple graphics, icons, and small animations.<br>
                Limited to 256 colors.<br>
                Supports simple animations through multiple frames.<br>
                Small file size, especially for simple graphics and animations
            <li><strong>SVG</strong><br>
                Ideal for logos, icons, and illustrations. Scalable without loss of quality.<br>
                Generally small file size for simple graphics, but can vary.
            <li><strong>WebP</strong><br>
                Provides both lossy and lossless compression. Generally offers smaller file sizes.<br>
                Widely supported in modern browsers.<br>
                Typically smaller file size than JPG or PNG.
            <li><strong>AVIF</strong><br>
                A modern image format designed for high-quality compression, suitable for a wide range of images.<br>
                Utilizes the AV1 video codec for efficient compression.<br>
                Becoming increasingly supported in modern browsers.<br>
                Generally offers excellent compression, resulting in smaller file sizes compared to JPEG and PNG while maintaining high quality.
        </ul>
        <br>
        Another important aspect is, when an image is loaded. The loading type is normally on eager (<code>loading="eager"</code>).<br>
        That means that the image is loaded as soon as the webpage is loaded.<br>
        You can set <code>loading="lazy"</code> to only load the image if it is on-screen.<br>
        That can help, for example if you have a huge gallery. In the <code>eager</code> state, all images would be loaded at the start.

        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <p>
            Because images are an important part of the web and included on basically every website, it's vital
            to ensure they are accessible to all users. This includes providing descriptive alt text for screen readers.
            Hover over the image to look at its alternative text (this can be done using the title-attribute).
        </p>
        <img width="80%" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/05/08/08/49/mountains-757731_1280.jpg"
            alt="A field of pink flowers and a lone pink tree in front of white, snowy mountains."
            title="A field of pink flowers and a lone pink tree in front of white, snowy mountains.">

        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    CSS is more powerful than you think. Many problems you think you need JavaScript for can
                    be solved by using the right HTML-Tags and CSS-Styling - We mostly didn't use any JS
                    for our code examples.
